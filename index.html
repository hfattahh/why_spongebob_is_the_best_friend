        <h3>About Mr.Squarpants</h3>
        <p class = "content_text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;An energetic and optimistic sea sponge who lives in a submerged pineapple with his pet snail <strong>Gary</strong>, who meows like a cat.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;SpongeBob has a childlike enthusiasm for life, which carries over to his job as a fry cook at a fast food restaurant called the <strong>Krusty Krab</strong>.
          His greatest goal in life is to obtain a license to drive a boatmobile.
          His favorite pastimes include <strong>"jellyfishing"</strong>,
          which involves catching jellyfish with a net in a manner similar to butterfly catching,
          and blowing soap bubbles into elaborate shapes.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Living two houses away from SpongeBob is his best friend Patrick Star, a dim-witted yet friendly pink</p>
